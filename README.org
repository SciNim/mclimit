* mclimit 

This is a Nim port of the =TLimit= ROOT class for confidence level
computations for searches with small statistics.

The ROOT reference and implementation:
- https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTLimit.html
- https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TLimit_8cxx_source.html

The ROOT code itself is a C++ port of Tom Junk's =mclimit= C
implementation:
- [[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/9902006][HEP-EX/9902006]]

The goal is a Weave multithreaded version of mclimit. The first
version will be single threaded, since I first need to get
multithreaded RNG right.
